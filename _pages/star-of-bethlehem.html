D         G
Is it hard
          A
When you wake up
          D
In the morning
D         G
And you find out
          A
That those other days
D
Are gone?
G
All you have
A                 D
Is memories of happiness
E       A    G    F#m
Lingering on

All your dreams
And your lovers
Won't protect you
They're only passing
Through you in the end
They'll leave
You stripped of all
That they can get to
And wait for you
To come back again

Yet still a light is shining
From that lamp on down the hall
Maybe the star of Bethlehem
Wasn't a star at all
