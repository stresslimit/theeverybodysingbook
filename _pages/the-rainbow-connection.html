title: 'The Rainbow Connection'
---

C             Am      F             G
Why are there so many songs about rainbows,
     C             Am    F    G
and what's on the other side?
C             Am      F          G
Rainbows are visions, but only illusions.
C                   Am    F
Rainbows have nothing to hide.


Fmaj7
So we've been told and some choose to believe it.
Em7
I know they're wrong; wait and see.


Dm                G          Em7        A
Some day we'll find it, the rainbow connection,
Dm               G             C
The lovers, the dreamers, and me.


C             Am              Dm              G
Who said that every wish will be heard and answered
      C             Am    F     G
when wished on a morning star?
C          Am                  F         G
Somebody thought of that and someone believed him.
C               Am    F
Look what it's done so far.


Fmaj7
What's so amazing and keeps us stargazing?
Em7
What do we think we might see?


Dm                G          Em7        A
Some day we'll find it, the rainbow connection,
Dm               G             C
The lovers, the dreamers, and me.


[Bridge]
G/B        Am         C
All of us under its spell,
F                 C/E       G  Ab
We know that it's probably magic


[Verse 3] (Key Change)
Db             A#m               Gb         Ab
Have you been half asleep and have you heard voices?
Db               A#m    Gb        Ab
I've heard them calling my name.
Db             A#m                 Gb             Ab
Are these the sweet sounds that called the young sailors?
    Db             A#m          Gb
The voice might be one and the same.


Gbmaj7
I've heard it too many times to ignore it.
Fm7                                 Ab
It's something that I'm supposed to be.


Gb             Ab            Fm7     A#
Someday we'll find it the rainbow connection,
Gb               Ab            Db
the lovers, the dreamers and me.


[Outro]
Ab/C     A#m        Db
Da-da-da-dee-dee-da-dum
Gb    Ab       Db
Da-da-da-dee-da-roo
