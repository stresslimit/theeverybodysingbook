C                                 G
I feel so bad, I got a worried mind; I'm so lonesome all the time
G                              C
Since I left my baby behind on Blue Bayou
C                             G
Saving nickels, saving dimes; working till the sun don't shine
G                                     C
Looking forward to happier times on Blue Bayou


[Chorus 1]
C                                    G
I'm going back someday, come what may to Blue Bayou
      G                                        C
Where the folks are fine, and the world is mine on Blue Bayou
        C                        C7               F            Fm6
Where those fishing boats with their sails afloat, if I could only see
 C                        G                C
That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes, how happy I'd be


[Verse 2]
C                                 G
Gonna see my baby again; Gonna be with some of my friends
G                               C
Maybe I'll feel better again on Blue Bayou
C                 C            G
Saving nickels, saving dimes; working till the sun don't shine
G                    G                C
Looking forward to happier times on Blue Bayou


[Chorus 2]
C                                    G
I'm going back someday, come what may to Blue Bayou
      G                                        C
Where the folks are fine, and the world is mine on Blue Bayou
        C                        C7               F            Fm6
Where those fishing boats with their sails afloat, if I could only see
 C                        G                C
That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes, how happy I'd be

[Outro]
     C           C7              F                   Fm6
Oh, that boy of mine by my side, the silver moon and the evening time
C                     G              C
Oh, some sweet day, gonna take away this hurtin' inside
      G
Well, I'd never be blue, my dreams come true
G    G    C
On Blue Ba - you
