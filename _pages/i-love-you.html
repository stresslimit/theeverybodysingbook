F/E
It's not true
C
Tell me I've been lied to
F/E
Cryin' isn't like you
C
Ooh

What the hell did I do?
Never been the type to
Let someone see right through
Ooh

F
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
G
And nothin' has to change today
You didn't mean to say,
Am
"I love you"
C
I love you and I don't want to
Ooh

Up all night
on another red eye
I wish we never learned to fly
I ....

Maybe we should just try
To tell ourselves a good lie
I didn't mean to make you cry
I ....

Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothin' has to change today
You didn't mean to say, "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to
Ooh

Dm
The smile that you gave me
Em
Even when you felt like dyin'

We fall apart as it gets dark
I'm in your arms in Central Park
There's nothin' you could do or say
I can't escape the way I love you
I don't want to, but I love you
