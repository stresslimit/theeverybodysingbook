Cm
The devil has designed my death
G                     Cm
And is waiting to be sure
Plenty of his black sheep died
Before he finds a cure

[chorus]
Cm           F
Oh Lord Jesus 
Cm                       F
Do you think I served my time?
Cm
 The eight legs of the devil now 
G                     Cm
Are crawling up my spine 

The firm hand
Of the devil now
Is rocking me to sleep
I force my blind eyes open Lord
But I'm sinking in the deep

Chorus

I go to sleep each evening now
Dreaming of the grave
I see the friends I used to know
Crawling up my leg

[final chorus]
Oh Lord Jesus 
Here's the news from the fires below 
The eight legs of the devil will not
 Let my people go
