come on strong girl
lay the heavy trip on me
the church of mad love
is such a holy place to be
make me baby make me know you really care
make me jump into the air

keep you electric eye on me babe
put your ray gun to my head
press your space face close to mine love
freak out in a moonage daydream

keep your mouth shut
and listen to the word inside
keep your head on
and open up your eyes real wide
keep the change strong
let the things you've torn aside
there isn't any room to hide
