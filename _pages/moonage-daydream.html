C

Em                        Am
lay the heavy trip on me
Am/G

F#/D
is such a holy place to be
F

C
make me know you really care
Em
make me jump into the air
Am   Am/G   F#/D


F                 C         F#/D
keep you electric eye on me babe
F                 C         D
put your ray gun to my head
F                 C         F#/D
press your space face close to mine love
C                           F#/D

C
keep your mouth shut
Em                        Am
and listen to the word inside
Am/G
keep your head on
F#/D
and open up your eyes real wide
F
keep the change strong
C
let the things you've torn aside
Em
there isn't any room to hide
Am   Am/G   F#/D

keep you electric eye on me babe
F                 C         D
put your ray gun to my head
F                 C         F#/D
press your space face close to mine love
C
freak out in a moonage daydream
F#/D

Am   G   F   E
