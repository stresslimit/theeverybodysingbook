title: Homeward Bound
---
 
    G
I'm sitting in the railway station.
      Bm            F        E E7
Got a ticket for my destination.
Am                               F
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand.
    G                                  D                  G
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band.

[Chorus]

         C
Homeward bound,
         G
I wish I was,
         C
Homeward bound

G             F
Home where my thought's escaping,
G             F
Home where my music's playing,
G             F
Home where my love lies waiting
D        G
Silently for me.

[Verse 2]

G
Ev'ry day's an endless stream
   Bm             F      E E7
Of cigarettes and magazines.
    Am                                  F
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories
    G                           D                         G
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be,

[Chorus]

         C
Homeward bound,
         G
I wish I was,
         C
Homeward bound

G             F
Home where my thought's escaping,
G             F
Home where my music's playing,
G             F
Home where my love lies waiting
D        G
Silently for me.

[Verse 3]

G
Tonight I'll sing my songs again,
     Bm                F    E E7
I'll play the game and pretend.
    Am                              F
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity
     G                      D                       G
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me.

[Chorus]

         C
Homeward bound,
         G
I wish I was,
         C
Homeward bound

G             F
Home where my thought's escaping,
G             F
Home where my music's playing,
G             F
Home where my love lies waiting
D        G
Silently for me.

[Outro]

D        G
Silently for me.
