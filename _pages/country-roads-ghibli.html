G             Em
I dreamed of living alone but fearless,
D             C         G
Secret longing to be courageous,
G             Em
loneliness kept bottled up inside,
D
just reveal your brave face they’ll
C         G
never know you lied.

G              D
Country road may lead me home,
         Em                  C
Know i belong there all on my own
G                         D
destiny calls, motionless I stall,
            C
no I can’t go,
        G
Country road.

No matter how dark the world’s inside me
I’ll never stop to show the tears that I’ve shed,
but nowI have to walk so fast,
running, sprinting to forget
what is lodged in my head.

Country Road, may lead me home, know I belong
there all on my own. Destiny calls, motionless
I stall no I can’t go country roads.

country road, la la la la. You’re a good friend
I’ll never know. Same tomorrow, regret and sorrow,
can’t take you home. Country Road.
