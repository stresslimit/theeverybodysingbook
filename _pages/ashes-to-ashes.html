Drop D
Am      G       Dm      Am

G
Do you remember a guy that's been
Em
in such an early song
C
I've heard a rumor from ground control,
D
oh no, don't say it's true

F
They got a message from the action man,
C             Bm7
I'm happy, hope you're happy too
F
I've loved all I've needed love,
G    E/G#
sordid details following

A
The shrieking of nothing is killing me
    E
Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis and I
G                                     D
Ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair
F                                        C     Em
But I'm hoping to kick but the planet is glowing


F                       G
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky,
C            Am
we know Major Tom's a junkie
F                       G
Strung out in heaven's high,
            Am      G     Dm    Am
hitting an all time low

Time and again I tell myself
I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me, oh no, not again

I'm stuck with a valuable friend,
I'm happy, hope you're happy too
One flash of light but no smoking pistol,

I've never done good things
I've never done bad things, I've never done anything out of the blue
I want an axe to break the ice, I want to come down right now

Ashes to ashes, funk to funky,
we know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in heaven's high,
hitting an all time low

Am  G  Dm  Am  repeat
My mama said to get things done,
you'd better not mess with Major Tom
