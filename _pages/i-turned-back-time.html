                 D
I’ve turned down love
                 Bm
I’ve turned down freedom
                 D
i’ve turned down friends
            Bm
when most i need em
              G                 Bm
and i’ve been proud of shameful things
              G
and i’ve been out

//// [noteless]

I’ve turned down pride
I’ve turned down reason
I had a pride
for every season
and I’ve been proud of where i’ve been

I've been right there
I've heard machineguns
I've felt more joy than u can dream of
and i've seen more than u would know

and if u don't know by now, you will never never never know
and if u can't see my smile, it'll never never never show
