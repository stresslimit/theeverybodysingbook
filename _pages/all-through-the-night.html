title: 'All Through the Night'

D         G         E7     A
Sleep my child and peace attend thee,
G     A          D
All through the night
D         G         E7     A
Guardian angels God will send thee,
G     A          D
All through the night
G
Soft the drowsy hours are creeping
Em                  D       A
Hill and vale in slumber sleeping,
D         G         E7     A
I my loving vigil keeping
G     A          D
All through the night.

While the moon her watch is keeping
All through the night
While the weary world is sleeping
All through the night
O'er thy spirit gently stealing
Visions of delight revealing
Breathes a pure and holy feeling
All through the night.

Though I roam a minstrel lonely
All through the night
My true harp shall praise sing only
All through the night
Love's young dream, alas, is over
Yet my strains of love shall hover
Near the presence of my lover
All through the night
