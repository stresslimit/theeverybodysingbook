A letter to my future self

by Salem Ilese:
G
Is Mr. Brightside still your favorite song?
D
And tell me, is your hair still blonde
C
or did you dye it pink?
Cm
Did it stain the bathroom sink?
G
Do you still spend sundays watching Friends
D
and writing notes you’ll never send?
C
And did you see the world and finally learn
Cm
that growing up doesn’t have to hurt?
G

by Collis Browne:
C
Do you live on several different coasts?
C+
Do you still make coffee for you both?
F
Do you spend your summers in the sun?
Fm
Do you feel somehow you've won?

C
Did write those songs you started to?
C+
Did you wipe your doubting heart and
F
expose the flowers underneath?
Fm
Do you still wear your silver teeth?

Am
Do you still live closely with your girls?
G
Do you talk with them about their world?
Am
Did you help them do you know for sure
G
that they felt the soft truth of your words
F
and learned
Fm
That growing up didn’t have to hurt?
Am
F                     Fm                    C
Cause growing up doesn’t have to hurt.
