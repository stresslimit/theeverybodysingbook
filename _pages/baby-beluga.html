C
Baby Beluga in the deep blue sea
                     G
Swim so wild and you swim so free
G7
Heaven above and the sea below
G                        C
And a little white whale on the go

Chorus:
F            C            D
Baby Beluga, baby Beluga, is the water warm?
                  G        G7    G
Is your mama home with you so happy?

C
Way down yonder where the dolphins play
                   G
Where you dive and splash all day
G7
Waves roll in and the waves roll out
G                           C
See the water squirting out of your spout

Chorus:
F                C            D
Baby Beluga, oh, baby Beluga, sing your little song
                           G          G7      G
Sing for all your friends, we'll like to hear you

C
When it's dark you're home and fed
                     G
Curl up snug in your water bed
G7
Moon is shining and the stars are out
G                         C
Good night, little whale, goodnight

Chorus:
F                C            D
Baby Beluga, oh, baby Beluga, with tomorrow's sun
                     G           G7   G
Another day's begun, you'll soon be waking

C
Baby Beluga in the deep blue sea
                     G
Swim so wild and you swim so free
G7
Heaven above and the sea below
G                        C
And a little white whale on the go
G                                C
You're just a little white whale on the go
