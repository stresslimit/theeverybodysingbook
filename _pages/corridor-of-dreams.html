title: 'Corridor of Dreams'
---

G  A  D

It's a corridor of dreams
  that gave me everything I own,
And I traveled 'round the world
  and I never really had a home,
And the one thing I learned was
  I never want to be alone,
I was ooooooh... Lookin'...

Well there's friends that come in and there's
  friends that go out of my life,
And things which occur when you
  balance on the edge of a knife,
And I never considered the
  idea of taking a dive,
It was ooooooh... Livin'...

It's a messed up, mucked up,
  crying kind of a place,
Sayin' goodbye is
  something I could never face,
It's meant to get easier
  the more that you have to take,
But it's ooooooh.... Harder...

So take some time,
  it won't be misspent on me,
If you stay another day
  I swear I'll make you see,
It's not where you are,
  it's where you feel you should be,
And it's where... your heart is...
