title: When the Man Comes Around
---


There's a man, goin' 'round, takin' names
C/G
And he decides, who to free, and who to blame
C/G
Everybody, won't be treated, all the same
C                            **           Am
There'll be a golden ladder, reaching down
F           G             C/G
  When the man comes around

C/G
The hairs, on your arm, will stand up
C/G
At the terror, in each sip, and in each sup
C/G
Will you partake of that last offered cup?
C/G                             **    Am
Or disappear, into the potter's ground?
F           G             C/G
  When the man comes around


C
Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
C
One hundred million angels singin'
C                               F   C    G
Multitudes are marchin' to the big kettledrum
G
Voices callin', voices cryin'
G
Some are born and some are dyin'
G                              C
It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come



[Bridge]
(C)      F                   C
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
        C/G
And the virgins are all trimming their wicks
     F                   C
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
     C/G
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks


[Verse 2]
---------
C/G
Till Armageddon, no shalam, no shalom
C/G
Then the father hen will call his chickens home
C/G
The wise men will bow down before the throne
C/G                                **      Am
And at his feet they'll cast their golden crownsâ€¦
F           G              C/G
  When the man comes around

C/G
Whoever is unjust, let him be unjust still
C/G
Whoever is righteous, let him be righteous still
C/G
Whoever is filthy, let him be filthy still
C/G                        **        Am
Listen to the words long written down
F           G              C
  When the man comes around


C
Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
C
One hundred million angels singing
C                               F   C    G
Multitudes are marchin' to the big kettledrum
G
Voices callin', voices cryin'
G
Some are born and some are dyin'
G                              C
It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come


[Bridge]
(C)      F                   C
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
C/G
And the virgins are all trimming their wicks
F                   C
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
     C/G
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks

   C/G                                Am
In measured a hundredweight and penny pound
F           G             C/G
  When the man comes around
