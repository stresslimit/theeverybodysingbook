Em       D           C           B7
Old Mr. Johnson had troubles of his own
He had a yellow cat which wouldn't leave its home
He tried & he tried to give the cat away
He gave it to a man going far, far away

Chorus:
But the cat came back the very next day
The cat came back, they thought he was a goner
But the cat came back, it just couldn't stay away

He gave it to a man going up in a balloon
He told him for to take it to the man in the moon
The balloon came down about 90 miles away
And where he is now I dare not say

... But ...
[Chorus]

He gave it to a man goin' way out west
Told him for to take it to the one he loved the best
First the train hit the curve, then it jumped the rail
Not a soul was left behind to tell the gruesome tail

... But ...
[Chorus]
