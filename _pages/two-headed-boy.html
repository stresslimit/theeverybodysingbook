G          B
Two headed boy
    G           B
All floating in glass
    G          B
The sun it has passed
         C            G
Now it's blacker than black
      C                      D
I can hear as you tap on your jar
     C                           G
I am listening to hear where you are
     C                           G
I am listening to hear where you are

G          B
Two headed boy
G              B
Put on sunday shoes
    G               B        C        G
And dance round the room to accordion keys
         C                         D
With the needle that sings in your heart
         C                         G
Catching signals that sound in the dark
         C                         G
Catching signals that sound in the dark
        D            C
We will take off our clothes
                       G                   D               C
And they'll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine
                          G                D               C
And when all is breaking, everything that you could keep inside
                           Am                               D
Now your eyes ain't moving now, they just lay there in their climb

G          B
Two headed boy
     G           B
With pulleys and weights
   G      B        C              G
Creating a radio played just for two
       C                             D
In the parlor with a moon across her face
    C                            G
And through the music he sweetly displays
       C                        G
Silver speakers that sparkle all day
             C                        Am                                D    C
Made for his lover who's floating and choking with her hands across her face
           G            D             C
And in the dark we will take off our clothes
                        G                  D               C
And they'll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine
                          G                D               C
And when all is breaking, everything that you could keep inside
                           Am                                D
Now your eyes ain't moving now, they just lay there in their cli-i-i-i-imb

G          B
Two headed boy
          G         B
Ther's no reason to grieve
    G              B                  C           G
The world that you need is wrapped in gold silver sleeves
     C                              D
Left beneath Christmas trees in the snow
           C                      G
And I will take you and leave you alone
         C                       G
Watching spirals of white softly flow
          C
Over your eyelids and all you did
                                       D
Will wait until the point when you let go
C                           G
Dee dee dee dee dee dee du dee dee
C                            G
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee
C                                           G
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee
