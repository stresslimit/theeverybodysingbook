[Intro]
G    C G      G    D G

[Verse]
G         C       G
Love Is A Burning Thing
G               D     G
And It Makes A Fiery Ring
         C    G
Bound By Wild Desire
G              D       G
I Fell Into A Ring Of Fire

[Chorus]
D             C               G
I Fell Into A Burning Ring Of Fire
       D
I Went Down, Down, Down
        C           G
And The Flames Went Higher

And It Burns, Burns, Burns
    D       G
The Ring Of Fire
    D       G
The Ring Of Fire



G             C       G
The Taste Of Love Is Sweet
G                 D    G
When Hearts Like Ours Meet
G               C      G
I Fell For You Like A Child
G             D         G
Ohh, But The Fire Went Wild

[Chorus]
D             C               G
I Fell Into A Burning Ring Of Fire
       D
I Went Down, Down, Down
        C           G
And The Flames Went Higher

And It Burns, Burns, Burns
    D       G
The Ring Of Fire
    D       G
The Ring Of Fire
