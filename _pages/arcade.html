F       G    Em       F
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
F       G    Em       F
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh


[Verse 1]
    F    G        Em         F
A broken heart is all that's left
F         G      Em      F
I'm still fixing all the cracks
F      G         Em     Fmaj7
Lost a couple of pieces when
   F          G           Em         F
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
F      G      Em    F
I'm afraid of all I am
   F          G      Em      F
My mind feels like a foreign land
F       G           Em    Fmaj7
Silence ringing inside my head
        F         G         Em       F
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home


[Pre-Chorus]
F                  G
I spent all of the love I've saved
Am                G
We were always a losing game
F                   G
Small-town boy in a big arcade
Dm
I got addicted to a losing game


[Chorus]
Am G C F
Ooh, ooh
      Am          G
All I know, all I know
F
Loving you is a losing game


[Verse 2]
F        G       Em      F
How many pennies in the slot?
F         G         Em     F
Giving us up didn't take a lot
F         G         Em    Fmaj7
I saw the end 'fore it begun
         F         G          Em    F
Still I carried, I carried, I carry on


[Chorus]
Am G C F
Ooh, ooh
      Am          G
All I know, all I know
F
Loving you is a losing game
Am G C F
Ooh, ooh
       Am         G
All I know, all I know
F
Loving you is a losing game


[Bridge]
Dm                 C             G
I don't need your games, game over
C               C/E        F
Get me off this rollercoaster


[Chorus]
N.C.
Ooh, ooh

All I know, all I know

Loving you is a losing game
Dm Em F G
Ooh, ooh
      Am          G
All I know, all I know
F
Loving you is a losing game


[Outro]
F       G    Em       F
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
F       G    Em       F
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
