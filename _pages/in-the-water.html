title: In the Water

D
The sun don't always shine 
G
In the daytime
In the daytime
A
At least that's what I've found

The moon don't always rise
In the nighttime
But always comes around

The air ain't always warm
In the morning
At least that's what I'm told

The wind ain't always cold
In the evening
Turns us into gold

I lose myself today 
In the water
Carry me away

I find myself today
In the water
Sail me back again
