G
By the rivers of Babylon
G              D
Where we sat down
               D
And there we wept
G
When we remembered Zion

Cause, the wicked carried us away in captivity
Required from us a song
How can we sing King Alpha's song
In a strange land?
[ Repeat ]

Sing it aloud (ah ah ah ahh)
Sing the song of freedom brother(ah ah ah ah)
Sing the song of freedom ah sister (ah ah ah ahh)
(Ah ah ah ah) we gonna walk and shout it
(Ah ah ah ahh) we gonna sing and shout it eh eh
(Ah ah ah ahh) shout the song of freedom now

So let the words of our mouth
And the meditation of our heart
Be acceptable in Thy sight
Oh, verai!

Sing, sing it again (ah ah ah ahh)
We gotta sing it together (ah ah ah ahh)

By the rivers of Babylon
Where we sat down
And there we wept
When he remembered Zion

Cause, the wicked carried us away in captivity
Required from us a song
How can we sing King Alpha's song
In a strange land?
