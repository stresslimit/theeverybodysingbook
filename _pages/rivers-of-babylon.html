G
By the rivers of Babylon
G
Where we sat down
               D
And there we wept
G
When we remembered Zion

Cause, the wicked carried us away in captivity
Required from us a song
How can we sing King Alpha's song
In a strange land?
[ Repeat ]

Sing it aloud (ah ah ah ahh)
Sing the song of freedom brother(ah ah ah ah)
Sing the song of freedom ah sister (ah ah ah ahh)
(Ah ah ah ah) we gonna walk and shout it
(Ah ah ah ahh) we gonna sing and shout it eh eh
(Ah ah ah ahh) shout the song of freedom now

G                               D
So let the words of our mouth
G                               D
And the meditation of our heart
G                               D
Be acceptable in Thy sight
G
Oh, Far I!

Sing, sing it again (ah ah ah ahh)
We gotta sing it together (ah ah ah ahh)


G
By the rivers of Babylon
G
Where we sat down
                  D
And there we wept
                  Em [ minor alternate variation ]
When we remembered Zion

Cause, the wicked carried us away in captivity
Required from us a song
How can we sing King Alpha's song
In a strange land?
