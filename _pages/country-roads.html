A             F#m            E                         D         A
 Almost Heaven; West Virginia, Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
A                   F#m                    E
 Life is old there, older than the trees, younger than the mountains,
  D              A
Growin' like a breeze.


         A              E            F#m        D
Country Roads, take me home, to the place, I belong,
         A               E             D             A
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.


A               F#m                E                 D              A
 All my memories gather 'round her, miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
A                 F#m                 E
 Dark and dusty, painted on the sky, misty taste of moonshine,
  D            A
Teardrop in my eye.


         A              E            F#m        D
Country Roads, take me home, to the place, I belong,
         A               E             D             A
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.


[Bridge]

F#m            E            A
   I hear her voice in the morning hour she calls me,
    D        A             E
The radio reminds me of my home far away.
    F#m               G            D
And driving down the road I get a feeling
       A                     E                 E7
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday.


         A              E            F#m        D
Country Roads, take me home, to the place, I belong,
         A               E (or G)             D             A
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.
         A              E            F#m        D
Country Roads, take me home, to the place, I belong,
         A               E             D             A
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.
         E                  A              E                  A
Take me home, down country roads; take me home, down country roads
