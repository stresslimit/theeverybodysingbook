G             Em
Almost Heaven; West Virginia,
D                         C         G
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
G                   Em
Life is old there, older than the trees,
D
younger than the mountains,
C              G
Blowin' like a breeze.

[Chorus]

     G              D            Em         C
Country Roads, take me home, to the place, I belong,
     G               D             C
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home,
G
country roads.


G               Em                D                 C              G
All my memories gather round her, miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
G                 Em                  D
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky, misty taste of moonshine,
C            G
Teardrop in my eye.

[Chorus]

     G              D            Em         C
Country Roads, take me home, to the place, I belong,
     G               F             C             G
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.


[Bridge]

Em             D            G
I hear her voice in the morning hour she calls me,
C        G             D
The radio reminds me of my home far away.
Em                F            C
And driving down the road I get a feeling
   G                     D                 D7
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday.


     G              D            Em         C
Country Roads, take me home, to the place, I belong,
     G               D             C             G
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.
     G              D            Em         C
Country Roads, take me home, to the place, I belong,
     G               D             C             G
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.
     D                  G              D                  G
Take me home, down country roads; take me home, down country roads
