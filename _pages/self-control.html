A                                        F#m
I'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight
Bm
Noses on a rail,
Bm
little virgin wears the white
E
You cut your hair but you used to live a blonded life

Wish I was there, wish we'd grown up on the same advice
And our time was right
Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing

It's no thing, it's nothing
Keep a place for me, for me
Now and then you miss it, sounds make you cry
Some nights you dance with tears in your eyes

I came to visit, 'cause you see me like a UFO
That's like never,
'cause I made you use your self-control

And you made me lose my
self-control, my self-control
Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's no thing

Keep a place for me
It's no thing, it's nothing
It's no thing, it's nothing

A
I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
C#m
Take down some summer time
Give us, just tonight, night, night
D
I, I, I know you got someone comin'
F#m
You're spittin' game, know you got it
