Bm C#m D C#m 2x


[Verse 1]

       Bm      C#m     D  E
Once I heard a serpent remark
        F#m    F#m/G     F#m  F#m/F
"If you try to evoke the spark
        Esus4 D C#m
You can fly
F#m         Bm   D
through the dark
       C#m          D
With a red midnight raven
   C#m             F#m     A7
To rule the battleground"


[Chorus]

     D       C#m           Bm
So I drew my sword and got ready
        E9                     A
But the lamb ran away with the crown
Bm C#m D     C#m           Bm
So I drew my sword and got ready
        E9                     A
but the lamb ran away with the crown


Bm C#m D C#m 2x


[Verse 2]

         Bm       C#m     D   E
Tho' the beast within me's a liar
           F#m        F#m/G    F#m  F#m/F
He made me glow with a strange desire
       Esus4 D C#m
And I rode
F#m     Bm   D
on the fire,
       C#m         D
with a blue sacred opal
   C#m             F#m    A7
to bless the battleground


[Chorus]

       D        C#m       Bm
But I turned to see its reflection
        E9                     A
and the lamb ran away with the crown
       D        C#m       Bm
But I turned to see its reflection
        E9                     A
and the lamb ran away with the crown


Bm C#m D C#m 2x


[Verse 3]

       Bm    C#m      D   E
Once a demon lived in my brow
               F#m         F#m/G       F#m    F#m/F
I screamed and wailed and I cursed out loud
       Esus4 D C#m
And I sailed
F#m         Bm     D
through the clouds
   C#m         D
on ten crested cardinals
   C#m             F#m    A7
To guard my battleground


[Chorus]

       D         C#m       Bm
But I laughed so hard I cried
         E9                     A
And the lamb ran away with the crown
       D         C#m       Bm
But I laughed so hard I cried
         E9                     A
And the lamb ran away with the crown
