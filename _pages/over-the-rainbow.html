G          		Bm
Somewhere over the rainbow,
C       G
Way up high
Am       G                   Em
Thereâ€™s a land that I heard of
Am 		D	G
Once in a lullaby...

G          		Bm
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
C      	 G
Skies are blue
C       Cm		G		Em
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Am                D			G
Dream really do come true...


    G
Someday I'll wish upon a star
Am				D			Am		D
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
      G
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
F#
High above the chimney tops
	Bm			Am	D7
That's where you'll find me


G          		Bm
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
C       G
Blue birds fly
C       Cm		G		Em
Birds fly over the rainbow
Am                D			G
Why then oh why can't I...


    G
If happy little bluebirds fly
Am
beyond the rainbow
D7				G
Why oh why can't I...
