Am     Dm/A      E/A       F/A  G/A

A                              D/A
You could never know what it's like.
        E/A                              A
Your blood like winter freezes just like ice.
                    Bm7/A                     D/A        E
And there's a cold lonely light that shines from you.
        F#m                       D                A    Bm/A A
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you  use.
                                        D/A
And did you think this fool could never win?
       E/A                              A
Well look at me, I'm coming back again.
        Bm7/A                D/A     E
I got a taste of love in a simple way.
                F#m                                  D    A    Bm7/A  A
And if you need to know while I'm still standing you just fade a  -  way.


Chorus:
               Am7       Am                          Em7
Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did.
               Dm7                               Fmaj7      G
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid.
Am7     Am               Em7
I'm still standing after all this time.
                      Dm7                                 E7
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind.
            Am         Dm7          E7
I'm still standing.  Yeah yeah yeah!
            Am         Dm7          E7         F/E    G/E
I'm still standing.  Yeah yeah yeah!


A                          D/A
Once I never could hope to win.
       E/A                                   A
You starting down the road leaving me again.
      Bm7/A                                      D/A      E
The threats you made were meant to cut me down.
              F#m                 D                   A     Bm7/A    A
And if our love was just a circus you'd be a clown by   now.
                     Am7      Am                          Em7
Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did.
                     Dm7                               Fmaj7      G
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid.


[Chorus]
