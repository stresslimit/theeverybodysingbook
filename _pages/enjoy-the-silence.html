Drop D
G [start on B]	   D     G	   D

Bm
Words like violence
Dm
Break the silence
G
Come crashing in
G
Into my little world
Bm
Painful to me
Dm
Pierce right through me
G
Can't you understand?
G
Oh, my little girl

Em
All I ever wanted
G
All I ever needed
Bm
Is here
D
in my arms
Em
Words are very
G
unnecessary
Bm			Bb
They can only do harm

Vows are spoken
To be broken
Feelings are intense
Words are trivial
Pleasures remain
So does the pain
Words are meaningless
And forgettable

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
