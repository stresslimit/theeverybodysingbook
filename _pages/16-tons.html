title: 16 Tons
---

[Verse 1]
     N.C.
Some people say a man is made outta mud
  Am         G          D/F#       E
A poor man's made outta muscle an' blood...
Am         G         F        E
Muscle an' blood an' skin an' bone
  Am   N.C.
A mind that's weak and a back that's strong

[Chorus]
              Am      G     D/F#    E
     You load sixteen tons, whaddya get?
      Am         G         D/F#      E
     Another day older an' deeper in debt
           Am            G              F       E
     Saint Peter, doncha call me 'cause I can't go
       Am  N.C.
     I owe my soul to the company sto'

(Repeat riff)

[Verse 2]
      N.C.
I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine
  Am           G            D/F#          E
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
         Am      G       F           E
I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal
        Am    N.C.
And the straw boss said, "Well, bless my soul

[Chorus]
              Am      G     D/F#    E
     You load sixteen tons, whaddya get?
      Am         G         D/F#      E
     Another day older an' deeper in debt
           Am            G              F       E
     Saint Peter, doncha call me 'cause I can't go
       Am  N.C.
     I owe my soul to the company sto'

(Repeat riff)

[Verse 3]
      N.C.
I was born one mornin', it was drizzlin' rain
Am           G           D/F#      E
Fightin' and trouble are my middle name
      Am            G                 F          E
I was raised in the cane brake by an' ol' mama lion
          Am   N.C.
Cain't no high-tone woman make me walk the line

[Chorus]
              Am      G     D/F#    E
     You load sixteen tons, whaddya get?
      Am         G         D/F#      E
     Another day older an' deeper in debt
           Am            G              F       E
     Saint Peter, doncha call me 'cause I can't go
       Am  N.C.
     I owe my soul to the company sto'

(Repeat riff)

[Verse 4]
      N.C.
If ya see me comin' better step aside
  Am        G         D/F#       E
A lotta men didn't, a lotta men died
Am          G         F        E
One fist of iron, the other of steel
       Am    N.C.
If the right one don' get you then the left one will

[Chorus]
              Am      G     D/F#    E
     You load sixteen tons, whaddya get?
      Am         G         D/F#      E
     Another day older an' deeper in debt
           Am            Am/E           Dm
     Saint Peter, doncha call me 'cause I can't go
     N.C.
     I owe my soul to the company sto'

(Repeat riff)

Am
