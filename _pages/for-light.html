                                    D
I've been waking up before Dawn
                                    F#m
I've been see’n’ what I can see before it gets light
                                    D
I've been saying I’ll be long gone
                                    F#m
I've been seeing that it’s only bright inside
                                    D
I've been looking forever
B
I've been looking for light
Em        Bm
I've been looking for light
Em        Bm
I've been looking for light

                                    D
You’ve been staying up pacing
                                    F#m
You’ve been sleeping with the light left on in your room
                                    D
You’ve been looking through your old things
                                    F#m
You’ve been seeing that they only hold old truths
                                    D
You’ve been looking forever
B
For the light inside
Em        Bm
You’ve been looking for light
Em        Bm
You’ve been looking for light
Em        Bm
You’ve been looking for light

                                    D
I’ve been saying that i don’t care
                                    F#m
but every word i heard comes back to haunt my sleep
                                    D
I’ve been stepping out for fresh air
                                    F#m
but now i notice that it’s not as fresh as it seemed
                                    D
I've been breathing in easy
B
I got the light in sight
Em        Bm
I've been looking for light
Em        Bm
I've been looking for light
Emaj      Bm
We've been looking for light
