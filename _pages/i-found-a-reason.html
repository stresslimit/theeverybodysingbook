E                        A
I found a reason to keep livin'
Oh, and the reason is you
I found a reason to keep singin'
And the reason is you

E            C#m
Oh, I do believe
E            C#m
if you don't like things you leave
E            C#m
For someplace you've never gone
A
before

Ba ba ba ba ...

Honey, I found a reason to keep livin'
And you know the reason dear it's you
i found a way to make it stop repeating
And the reason is you

Oh, I do believe
if you don't like things you leave
For someplace you've never
gone before

Oh, I do believe
you are what you perceive
What comes is better than what
came before


And you better come, come to me
