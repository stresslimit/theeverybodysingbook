Am          Dbm
The morning bell
The morning bell
Light another candle and
G       D
Release me
Release me

You can keep the furniture
A bump on the head
Howling down the chimney
Release me
Release me
Please
Release me
Release me

Where'd you park the car?
Where'd you park the car?
Clothes are all over the furniture
Now I might as well
I might as well
Sleepy jack the fire drill
Run around, around, around, around, around, around
Around

Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half

A glass, a gun, a bullet for us will make
Everybody wants to be a friend and nobody wants to be a slave
Walking, walking, walking, walking
