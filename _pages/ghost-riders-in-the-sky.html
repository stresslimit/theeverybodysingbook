   Am                              C
An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day
 Am                          C
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
     Am                           C                Am
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
  F                                     Am
A'plowin' through the ragged skies, and up a cloudy draw

C                    Am
Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o
F          Dm     Am
Ghost herd in the sky

      Am                                  C
Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
      Am                                   C
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breaths he could feel
  Am                                    C                     Am
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
       F                                 Am
For he saw the riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry

C                    Am
Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o
F            Dm     Am
Ghost riders in the sky

      Am                                        C
Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, and shirts all soaked with sweat
        Am                                 C
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
        Am                          C               Am
They've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
   F                                      Am
On horses snortin' fire, as they ride on, hear their cry

C                    Am
Yi-pi-yi-o, Yi-pi-yi-o
F            Dm     Am
Ghost riders in the sky

       Am                               C
As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name
        Am                                  C
"If you want to save your soul from hell a' ridin' on our range"
      Am                               C                Am
"Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride"
   F                                 Am
"A-tryin' to catch the Devil's herd across these endless skies."

C                    Am
Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o
F            Dm     Am
Ghost riders in the sky
C                    Am
Yi-pi-yi-ay, Yi-pi-yi-o
