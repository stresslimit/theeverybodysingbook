                   A                          Dm
We passed upon the stair, we spoke of was and when
                   A                            F
Although I wasn't there, he said I was his friend
                   C                        A
Which came as a surprise, I spoke into his eyes
                     Dm                     C
I thought you died alone, a long long time ago

[Chorus]
C           F
Oh no, not me
   C#               F
We never lost control
C              F
You're face to face
         C#                    A
With The Man Who Sold The World

[Interlude 1]
A   Dm   F   Dm

I laughed and shook his hand, and made my way back home
I searched a foreign land, for years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazeless stare, we walked a million hills
I must have died alone, a long long time ago

[Chorus]
Who knows? Not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With The Man Who Sold The World

Chorus repeat
