Em
I don’t wanna talk
i’ve heard too many words for today
A
it may be good advice
but still i find it hard “just stay”
Em
don’t tell me anything
about me was false advertized
A
you’d already seen how good
i look in heels with your own eyes

Em
Don't leave me
A
Just leave me alone
Em
Don't leave me
Dsus4       D
Just leave me alone

Even when i find myself away from you part of the day
My mind fills up the silence with all the things i think you would say
Tell me what or yell me what you think you feel it comes from the heart
but my spirit knows that we're not meant to be far apart

Don’t leave me
Just leave me alone
Don’t leave me
Don’t leave me alone
