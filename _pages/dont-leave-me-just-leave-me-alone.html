I don’t wanna talk i’ve heard too many words for today
it may be good advice but still i find it hard “just stay”
don’t tell me anything about me was false advertized
you’d already seen how good i look in heels with your own eyes

Don't leave me
Just leave me alone

Even when i find myself away from you part of the day
My mind fills up the silence with all the things i think you would say
Tell me what or yell me what you think you feel it comes from the heart
but my spirit knows that we're not meant to be far apart

Don’t leave me
Don’t leave me alone
