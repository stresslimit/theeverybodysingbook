Am7/D   D

Am7            D
    I heard he sang a good song
G            C
  I heard he had a style
Am7          D
   and so I came to see him
   Em
to listen for a while.
Am7              D7
    And there he was this young boy
G             B7
   a stranger to my eyes.


Chorus:
Em                      Am
Strumming my pain with his fingers
D7                       G
singing my life with his words
Em                      A/C#
killing me softly with his song
D           C
killing me softly with his song
G               C
telling my whole life with his words.
Fmaj7
Killing me softly
E
with his song.


Am7           D
   I felt all flushed with fever
Gmaj7            C
     embarrassed by the crowd.
Am7          D
   I felt he found my letters
    Em
and read each one out loud.
Am7              D7
   I prayed that he would finish
Gmaj7             B7
      but he just kept right on.

Chorus

Am7           D
  He sang as if he knew me
Gmaj7        C
  in all my dark despair.
Am7              D
   And then he looked right through me
  Em
as if I wasn't there.
Am7            D7
  And he just kept on singing
Gmaj7         B7
     singing clear and strong.
