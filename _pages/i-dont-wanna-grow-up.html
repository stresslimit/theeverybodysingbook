[Verse]
      D                                 A                  D
Well, when I'm lying in my bed at night I don't wanna grow up
D                                       A                  D
Nothing ever seems to turn out right,   I don't wanna grow up
Bm                   F#m                 G          A
How do you move in a world of fog that's always changing things
Bm                 F#m          G  A
Makes me wish that I could be a do-og

[Verse]
      D                                 A                  D
Well, when I see the price that you pay I don't wanna grow up
D                               A                  D
I don't ever wanna be that way, I don't wanna grow up
Bm                    F#m              G     A
Seems like folks turn into things they never want to be
    Bm            F#m           G  A
The only thing to live for is toda-ay

I'm gonna put a hole in my TV set, I don't wanna grow up
Open up the medicine chest and     I don't wanna grow up
I don't wanna have to shout it out  I don't want my hair to fall out
I don't wanna be filled with doubt  I don't wanna be a good boy scout
I don't wanna hafta learn to count  I don't want to have the biggest amount
No, I don't want to grow up

Well, when I see my parents fight     I don't want to grow up
They all go out and drinkin' all night and I don't wanna grow up
I'd rather stay here in my room  Nothing out there but sad and gloom
I don't wanna live in a big ol' tomb on Grand Street

When I see the 5 o'clock news          I don't wanna grow up
Comb their hair and shine their shoes, I don't wanna grow up
Stay around in my ol' hometown  I don't wanna put no money down
I don't wanna get a big ol' loan  Work them fingers to the bone
I don't wanna float on a broom  Fall in love get married then boom
how the hell did it get here so soon
No, I don't want to grow up
