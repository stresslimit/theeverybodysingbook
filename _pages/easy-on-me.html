title: 'Easy On Me'
---

            C                Am7
There ain't no gold in this river
                Em                    Fmaj7
That I've been washing my hands in forever
G            C                 Am7
I know there is hope in these waters
             Em
But I can't bring myself to swim
    Fmaj7                  F
When I am drowning in this silence
            Fmaj7
Baby, let me in

[Chorus]
G C   Am7   G
Go easy    on me, baby
Em     Dm7
I was still a child
 C    Fmaj7              G
Didn’t get the chance to
C Am7    G
Feel the world around me
Em       Dm7
I had no time to choose
 C     Fmaj7
What I chose to do
       C        Am7  Em  Fmaj7
So go easy on me

[Verse 2]
 G          C
There ain't no room
               Am7
For things to change
             Em
When we are both so deeply
         Fmaj7
Stuck in our ways
 G         C
You can't deny
        Am7
How hard I have tried
          Em
I changed who I was
           Fmaj7
To put you both first
              Fmaj7
But now I give up

[Chorus]
G C   Am7  G
Go easy    on me, baby
Em     Dm
I was still a child
 C    Fmaj7
Didn’t get the chance to
C  Am7    G
Feel the world around me
Em       Dm
I had no time to choose
 C     Fmaj7
What I chose to do
      C  Am7 Em     Fmaj7
So go easy      on me

[Bridge]
C                Am7
I had good intentions
            Em
And the highest hopes
                   Fmaj7
But I know right now
                         Fmaj7
It probably doesn't even show

[Outro]
G C   Am7  G
Go easy    on me, baby
Em     Dm
I was still a child
 C    Fmaj7
Didn’t get the chance to
C  Am7    G
Feel the world around me
Em       Dm
I had no time to choose
 C     Fmaj7
What I chose to do
       C        Am7  Em Fmaj7
So go easy on me
