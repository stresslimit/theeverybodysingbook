Em C  D  G


Em          C     D            G
  I want to live,    I want to give
Em            C           D        G
  I've been a miner for a heart of gold
Em           C          D        G
  It's these expressions I never give
Em                             G
  That keep me searching for a heart of gold
C                       G
   And I'm getting old
Em                        G
  Keep me searching for a heart of gold
C                       G
   And I'm getting old


   [Verse 2]
Em             C          D              G
  I've been to Hollywood,   I've been to Redwood
Em                 C           D        G
  I've crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
Em             C        D             G
  I've been in my mind,   it's such a fine line

Em                              G
  That keeps me searching for a heart of gold
C                      G
   And I'm getting old
Em                              G
  That keeps me searching for a heart of gold
C                      G
   And I'm getting old

 Em7                       D        Em
   Keep me searching for a heart of gold
 Em                        G                  C       G
   I've been a miner for a heart of gold      ahhhhhh
