D        G            A        D
How many roads must a man walk down,
           G          D
before you call him a man
D        G           A          D
How many seas must a white dove sail,
           G             A
before she sleeps in the sand
         D        G              A           D
Yes, and how many times must the cannonballs fly,
               G       D
before they're forever banned

[Chorus]
G            A        D                G
The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind
              A              D
The answer is blowin' in the wind

[Verse]
         D        G           A         D
Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist,
             G             D
before it is washed to the sea
         D        G              A      D
Yes, and how many years can some people exist,
               G             A
before they're allowed to be free
         D        G           A            D
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head,
                     G           D
and pretend that he just doesn't see

[Chorus]
G            A        D                G
The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind
              A              D
The answer is blowin' in the wind

[Verse]
         D        G            A        D
Yes, and how many times must a man look up,
              G       D
before he can see the sky
         D        G         A       D
Yes, and how many ears must one man have,
              G           A
before he can hear people cry
         D        G              A            D
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows,
              G           D
that too many people have died

[Chorus]
G            A          D              G
The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind
              A              D
The answer is blowin' in the wind
