C               Em
Lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
         F          G
I have nobody for my own

        C               Em
I am so lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
           F                     G
Wish I had someone to call on the phone

Now I'm a soldier, a lonely soldier
          F                         Fm  G7
Away from home through no wish of my own
               C                 Em
That's why I'm lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
            F      G7        C
I wish that I could go back home




C                Em
Letters, never a letter
         F              G
I get no letters in the mail
          C               Em
I've been forgotten, yes, forgotten
         F                   G
Oh how I wonder, how is it I failed

Now I'm a soldier, a lonely soldier
          F                         Fm  G7
Away from home through no wish of my own
               C                 Em
That's why I'm lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
            F      G7        C
I wish that I could go back home
