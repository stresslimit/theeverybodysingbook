Am      C       G       Am
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
  G                                   Am
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
Am      C       G       Am
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
G                                     Am
Please don't take him just because you can

[Verse 1]
   Am           C
Your beauty is beyond compare
    G                Am
With flaming locks of auburn hair
   G                              Am
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
    Am              C
Your smile is like a breath of spring
    G                  Am
Your voice is soft like summer rain
  G                          Am
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene

[Verse 2]
 Am               C
He talks about you in his sleep
      G             Am
There's nothing I can do to keep
    G                              Am
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene
  Am            C
And I can easily understand
  G                 Am
How you could easily take my man
      G                                Am
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene

[Chorus]
Am      C       G       Am
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
  G                                   Am
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
Am      C       G       Am
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
G                                    Am
Please don't take him just because you can

[Verse 3]
Am                    C
You could have your choice of men
  G              Am
But I could never love again
G                          Am
He's the only one for me, Jolene
Am                C
I had to have this talk with you
 G            Am
My happiness depends on you
      G                        Am
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene

[Chorus]
Am      C       G       Am
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
  G                                   Am
I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
Am      C       G       Am
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
G                                    Am
Please don't take him even though you can
