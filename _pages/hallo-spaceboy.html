Bm
Spaceboy,you're sleepy now.
                        G7
Your silhouette is so stationary.
                          Bm
You're released but your custody calls
                    G7
and I want to be free. Don't you want to be free?
                     A
Do you like girls or boys?
          F
It's confusing these days.
    G7
But Moondust will cover you,
F#
Cover you.
              Bm            G7
This chaos is killing me.

[Chorus]
           Bm
So bye bye love,
             G7
Yeah bye bye love.
        Bm
Bye bye love,
             G7
Yeah bye bye love.

Bm  G7
              Bm          Bm
This chaos is killing me.
