Em                 C
I remember being you
F#                      B
Being told just what to do I thought that
G                 C
I was gonna live right through it
Em                  C
Thought I wouldn't give in to it
G                     C             D
Thought the world I lived in was my own

G                                 C
And Every time I wanna die I just remember
                Em
there's only 12 notes
C             G
But so many songs
C         Em
So i go on
C         Em
... I go on
C         G
... I go on

Em                 C
I remember being me
F#                      B
being shy of what I dream
G                 C
But now I know I will always be it
Em                  C
Know I gonna live to see it
G                     C             D
Know the world I live in is my own

G                                 C
And Every time I wanna die I just remember
                Em
there's only 12 notes
C             G
But so many songs
C         Em
So i go on
