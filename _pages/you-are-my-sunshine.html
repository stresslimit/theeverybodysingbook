title: You Are My Sunshine
---

A
The other night dear as I lay sleeping,
            D              A
I dreamed I held you in my arms,
        D                  A
When I awoke dear I was mistaken
     A        E          A
So I bowed my head and I cried,


[Chorus]

 A
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine,
            D                    A
You make me happy when skies are gray,
             D                     A
You'll never know dear, how much I love you,
                     E        A
Please don't take my sunshine away,


[Verse]

 A
I always loved you and made you happy,
             D                 A
and nothing else could come between,
               D                  A
but now you've left me to love another,
                   E      A
you have shattered all my dreams,


[Chorus]

 A
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine,
            D                    A
You make me happy when skies are gray,
             D                     A
You'll never know dear, how much I love you,
                     E        A
Please don't take my sunshine away,
