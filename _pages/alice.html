Am

Dm7
It's dreamy weather we're on
E7                Am7    A7
You waved your crooked wand
Dm7
Along an icy pond
        E7
with a frozen moon
        Am
A murder of silhouettes
Dm7
Crows I saw
E7
And the tears on my face
Dm7
And the skates on the pond
E7          Am
They spell Alice

I disappear in your name
But you must wait for me
Somewhere across the sea
There's a wreck of a ship
Your hair is like meadow grass
on the tide
And the raindrops on my window
And the ice in my drink
Baby all I can think of is Alice

Arithmetic arithmetock
Turn the hands back on the clock
How does the ocean rock the boat?
How did the razor find my throat?
The only strings that hold me here
Are tangled up around the pier

And so a secret kiss
Brings madness with the bliss
And I will think of this
When I'm dead in my grave
Set me adrift and I'm lost over there
And I must be insane
To go skating on your name
And by tracing it twice
I fell through the ice
Of Alice

There's only Alice
