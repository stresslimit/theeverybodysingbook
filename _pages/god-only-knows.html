G        D/F#           Em7        D


C/G              Am
I may not always love you,
Em      Em7           A
But long as there are stars above you,
D/A          Bbdim7
You’ll never need to doubt it,
D/A              Abm7b5
I'll make you so sure about it.


G        D/F#           Em7        D
God only knows what I'd be without you.


C/G                Am
If you should ever leave me,
Em      Em7             A
Though life would still go on believe me,
D/A                  Bbdim7
The world could show nothing to me,
D/A                Abm7b5
So what good would living do me.


G        D/F#              Em7     D
God only knows what I'd be without you.

C/G                Am
If you should ever leave me,
Em      Em7             A
Though life would still go on believe me,
D/A                  Bbdim7
The world could show nothing to me,
D/A                Abm7b5
So what good would living do me.


G        D/F#              Em7     D
God only knows what I'd be without you-oo,

God only knows what I'd be without you,
   (God only knows…)
