Intro:  G#  C#

G#
Been traveling these wide roads for so long
My heart’s been
C#
far from you
Ten-thousand miles gone
G#
Oh, I wanna come near and give ya
      C#
Every part of me
But there's blood on my hands
And my lips are unclean
G#
In my darkness I remember
Mama’s words reoccur to me
C#
"Surrender to the good Lord
And he’ll wipe your slate clean"


Chorus:
Bbm
Take me to your river
I wanna go
G#
Oh-oh-oh- oh
Take me to your river
I wanna know

G#
Tip me in your smooth waters I go in
As a man with many crimes
C#
Come up for air
As my sins flow down the Jordan
G#
Oh, I wanna come near and give ya
Every part of me
C#
But there is blood on my hands
And my lips are unclean

Chorus

G#
I wanna go, wanna go, wanna go
I wanna know, wanna know, wanna know
Wanna go, wanna go, wanna go
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know
Wanna go, wanna go, wanna go
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know
