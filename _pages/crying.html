C
I was all right for a while,

I could smile for a while

But I saw you last night,
            C+
you held my hand so tight,
       F                 Fm
as you stopped to say hello
        C                   G
Oh, you wished me well, you couldn't tell,
     G7  G
that I'd been . .

C       Em
Crying  over you
C       Em
Crying  over you
     F           G
Then you said so long,
        F             G
left me standing all alone
          C       C+      F       Fm
Alone and crying, crying, crying, crying
             C
It's hard to understand,
        G             G7
but the touch of your hand,
             C
can start me crying

C
I thought that I, was over you,

but it's true, so true

I love you even more,
       C+
than I did before
    F                   Fm
But darling, what can I do?
          C
Cause you don't love me,
         G      G7
and I'll always be

C       Em
Crying  over you
C       Em
Crying  over you
F               G
Yes, now you're gone
    F                G
And from this moment on
        C       C+      F       Fm
I'll be crying, crying, crying, crying

    C       Am
I'm crying, crying
F        G  G7 C
Oh-oh-oh-ov er you

G7 C F  C
