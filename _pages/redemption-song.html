G                      Em
Old Pirates, yes, they rob I.
C        C/B         Am
Sold I to the merchant ships
G                      Em  C         G         Am
minutes after they took I   from the bottomless pit.
   G            Em
But my hand was made strong
C          C/B        Am
By the hand of the Almighty.
 G                  Em   C          D
We forward in this generation triumphantly.

[Chorus]
                  G  C    D          G
Won't you help to sing    these songs of freedom?
   C     D       Em  C   D      G
'Cause all I ever had,    redemption songs,
C   D      G        C
redemption songs.

[Verse]

D     G                           Em
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery,
       C           G               Am
None but ourselves can free our minds.
   G                    Em
Have no fear for atomic energy,
          C         G              Am
'Cause none of them can stop the time.
G                        Em
How long shall they kill our prophets
    C       C/B              Am
While we stand aside and look?
         G            Em
Yes, some say it's just a part of it.
  C         G       D
We've got to fulfill the book.

[Chorus]

'Cause all I ever had,    redemption songs,
C   D      G        C
redemption songs.
