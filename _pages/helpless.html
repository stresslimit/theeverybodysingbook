D          A                G
There is a town in north Ontario,
D         A                    G
With dream comfort memory to spare,
D          A      G
and in my mind I still need a place to go,
D  A                 G
All my changes were there,


D          A          G
Blue, blue windows behind the stars,
D         A           G
Yellow moon on the rise,
D          A      G
Big birds flying across the sky,
D  A                 G
Throwing shadows on our eyes.


D         A             G
Helpless, helpless, helpless
D A                  G
Baby can you hear me now?
D        A                 G
The chains are locked and tied across the door,
D A       G
Baby, sing with me some how.


[Instrumental]

D  A  G  D  A  G


D          A         G
Blue, blue windows behind the stars,
D         A       G
Yellow moon on the rise,
D          A      G
Big birds flying across the sky,
D  A             G
Throwing shadows on our eyes.


[Outro](repeat and fade)

D         A             G
Helpless, helpless, helpless
