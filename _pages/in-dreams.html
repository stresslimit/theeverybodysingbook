C                                   Am
A candy colored clown they call the sandman,
Dm                       G7
tiptoes to my room every night.
C                                Am
Just to sprinkle stardust and to whisper,
      F            G7            C
Go to sleep...everything, is all right.


[Verse 1]

C                              Dm
I close my eyes, then I drift away.
         G           G7          C
Into the magic night....I softly say..
         C                     Dm
a silent prayer, like dreamers do.
            G              G7               C
Then I fall asleep to dream....my dreams of you.


[Verse 2]

   C          C6        G   G7    F         G        C
In dreams, I walk with you....in dreams, I talk, to you.
                 C7      D          D7              C    Dm
In dreams you're mine....all of the time, we're to..get..her,
G  C       Dm G7
in dreams, in dreams.


[Verse 3]

     C      Fm       C                   Fm       C
But, just before the dawn...I awake, and find you gone.
        C                              Dm
I can't help it, I can't help it, if I cry.
    G            G7            C
I remember, that you said, goodbye.
         C7       F         G
It's too bad that all these things, can only
C      F     G     G7
happen in my dreams.
C   Cmaj7    D7        Dm    G     C
On--ly  in dreams, in beau..tiful dreams
