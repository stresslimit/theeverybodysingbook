             C    F   C    C    F    F

C                  Em             Em          F
There's a black tinted sunset with the prettiest of skies
C                  Em             Em          F
Lay back, lay back, rest you head on my thighs
C                  Em             Em          F
There is some awful action that just breathes from my hand
C                  Em             Em          F
Just breaths from a deed so exquisetly grand
C       Em      F       F
And you are always on my mind
C       Em      F       F
And you are always on my mind
C       Em      F       F
And you are always on my mind
C       Em      F       F
And you are always on my mind

F                  F


C               C              F           F
Well, I would not have moved if I knew you were here
C               C              F           F
It's some special action with motives unclear
C               C              F           F
Now you'll haunt me, you'll haunt me till I've paid for what I've done
C               C              F           F
It's a payment which precludes the having of fun
C       Em      F       F
And you are always on my mind
C       Em      F       F
And you are always on my mind
C       Em      F       F
And you are always on my mind
C       Em      F       F
And you are always on my mind

C        F       C        F         C        F
But hello, oh I've got a new partner riding with me
C    F   C    C    F     F
I've got a new partner now

C               C              F           F
Now the sun's fading faster, we're ready to go
C               C              F           F
There's a skirt in the bedroom that's pleasantly low
C               C              F           F
And the loons on the moor, the fish in the flow
C               C              F           F
And my friends, my friends still will whisper hello
C               C              F           F
We all know what we know, it's a hard swath to mow
C               C              F           F
When you think like a hermit you forget what you know
C       Em      F       F
And you are always on my mind
C       Em      F       F
And you are always on my mind
C       Em      F       F
And you are always on my mind
C       Em      F       F
And you are always on my mind

C        F       C        F         C        F
Oh, oh I've got a new partner riding with me
C           F         C       F
I've got a new partner riding with me
C           F         C       F
I've got a new partner riding with me
C           F         C       F
I've got a new partner now
