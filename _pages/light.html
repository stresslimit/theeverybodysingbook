A

D
I've been waking up before Dawn
Bm
I've been see’n’ what I can see before it gets light
D
I've been saying I’ll be long gone
Bm
I've been seeing that it’s only bright inside
D
I've been looking forever
I've been looking for light
I've been looking for light  oh-oh-oh

You’ve been staying up pacing
You’ve been sleeping with the light left on in your room
You’ve been looking through your old things
You’ve been seeing that they only hold old truths
You’ve been looking forever
For the light inside
You’ve been looking for light
I've been looking for light

I've been down there where you are now
You think it’s lonely but it's only passing thru
You really taking the long route
You gotta trust yourself and what you got to pursue
You gotta know that worth it
You gotta know when it’s time
You’ve been looking for light

I’ve been saying that i don’t care
but every word i heard comes back to haunt my sleep
I’ve been stepping out for fresh air
but now i notice that it’s not as fresh as it seemed
I've been breathing in easy
I got the light in sight
I've been looking for light
