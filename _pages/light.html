A

D
I've been waking up before Dawn
F#m
I've been see’n’ what I can see
before it gets light
D
I've been saying I’ll be long gone
F#m
I've been seeing that it’s only bright inside
D
I've been looking forever
B
I've been looking for light
Em        Bm
I've been looking for light
Em        Bm
I've been looking for light

[Chorus]
E         Bm
I've been looking for light  oh-oh-oh
I've been looking for light  oh-oh-oh
I've been looking for light

You’ve been staying up pacing
You’ve been sleeping with the
light left on in your room
You’ve been looking through your old things
You’ve been seeing that they only hold old truths
You’ve been looking forever
For the light inside
You’ve been looking for light

[Chorus]
I've been looking for light  oh-oh-oh
I've been looking for light  oh-oh-oh
I've been looking for light

I’ve been saying that i don’t care
but every word i heard comes back to haunt my sleep
I’ve been stepping out for fresh air
but now i notice that it’s not as fresh as it seemed
I've been breathing in easy
I got the light in sight

[Chorus]
I've been looking for light  oh-oh-oh
I've been looking for light  oh-oh-oh
I've been looking for light
